    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>The Data Capture for IROAD 2 app allows you to enter data into a IROAD2 server with an Android device. The app downloads instances of forms which are required to enter data from the server, and stores them on the device. This means that you can enter data offline and then upload it to the IROAD2 server when you have network coverage. </para>
